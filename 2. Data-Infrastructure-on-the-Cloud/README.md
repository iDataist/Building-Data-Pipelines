# Data Infrastructure on the Cloud

## The Purpose of Creating the Database and ETL Pipeline on AWS

Sparkify, a startup company with a music streaming app, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. Sparkify would like to build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## Datasets

There are two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data

Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data

Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

### 1. Song Dataset
The song dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file in the song dataset is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json

song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

### 2. Log Dataset
The log dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis

### **Fact Table**
**1. songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
 - songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### **Dimension Tables**
**2. users** - users in the app
 - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*

**3. songs** - songs in music database
 - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*

**4. artists** - artists in music database
 - *artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude*

**5. time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
 - *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*

## ETL Pipeline

1. [create_tables.py](https://github.com/iDataist/Data-Engineering/blob/master/2.%20Data-Infrastructure-on-the-Cloud/create_tables.py) drops and creates the tables, which needs to be run before the ETL scripts to reset the tables.

2. [etl.py](https://github.com/iDataist/Data-Engineering/blob/master/2.%20Data-Infrastructure-on-the-Cloud/etl.py) loads the data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

3. [sql_queries.py](https://github.com/iDataist/Data-Engineering/blob/master/2.%20Data-Infrastructure-on-the-Cloud/sql_queries.py) contains all the sql queries, and is imported into the two files above.

4. [README.md](https://github.com/iDataist/Data-Engineering/blob/master/2.%20Data-Infrastructure-on-the-Cloud/README.md) provides documentation on the project.
